%   This example demonstrates basic transmission and reception of waveforms 
% between two WARP nodes.  One node will transmit a simple sinusoid and the 
% other node will receive the sinusoid.

% Requirements:
%     2 WARP nodes (same hardware generation); 2 RF interfaces each

% Get IDs for the interfaces on the boards.
