% wl_example_siso_txrx_energyTrigger.m
%
%   This example demonstrates energy trigger feature of WARP nodes.  It sends
% a waveform consisting of a simple sinusoidal payload.  The trigger manager
% uses the energy detector to trigger the receiving node instead of using an
% Ethernet trigger.
%
% NOTE:  It is a straight forward extension to use the automatic gain controller
%     with this example.
%
% Requirements:
%     2 WARP nodes (same hardware generation); 1 RF interface each
%     WARPLab 7.6.0 and higher
