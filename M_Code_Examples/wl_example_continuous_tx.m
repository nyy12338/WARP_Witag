% wl_example_continuous_tx.m
%
%   This example demonstrates continuous transmit feature of WARP nodes.
%
% Requirements:
%     2 WARP nodes (same hardware generation); 1 RF interface each
%     WARPLab 7.6.0 and higher
%
%
% NOTE:  This example will not work with WARPLab 7.5.x because nodes have the 
%     restriction that Read IQ / Write IQ cannot occur while transmitting or 
%     receiving.
