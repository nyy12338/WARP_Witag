% Create a vector of node objects
%     
% This experiment uses 3 nodes: 2 will act as a transmitter and 1 will act as a receiver:
%     nodes(1): Primary transmitter
%     nodes(2): Secondary transmitter (receives clocks and triggers from primary transmitter)
%     nodes(3): Receiver
%

% Read Trigger IDs into workspace
trig_in_ids  = wl_getTriggerInputIDs(node_tx1);
trig_out_ids = wl_getTriggerOutputIDs(node_tx1);

% For the primary transmit node, we will allow Ethernet to trigger the baseband buffers, 
% the AGC, and external output pin 0 (which is mapped to pin 8 on the debug header). We 
% also will allow Ethernet to trigger the same signals for the receiving node.
%

% For the secondary transmit node, we will allow external input pin 3 (mapped to pin 15 
% on the debug header) to trigger the baseband buffers, and the AGC
%
% Note that the below line selects both P0 and P3. This will allow the
% script to work with either the CM-PLL (where output P0 directly
% connects to input P0) or the CM-MMCX (where output P0 is usually
% connected to input P3 since both neighbor ground pins).

% pin 3 to guard against any noise in the trigger signal.

% transmitter's trigger outputs that drive the baseband buffers. An
% external trigger output on the primary transmitter will appear as a
% trigger input at the secondary transmitter a minimum of 5 clock cycles
% later (31.25ns). It will appear a minimum of 9 clock cycles later
% (56.25ns) when the debounce circuitry is enabled.

% to begin and propagate to the receiver so it can be sampled appropriately.
